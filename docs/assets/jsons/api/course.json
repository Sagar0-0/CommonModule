Once you have those installed, you will learn by building real applications like Instagram & Foursquare Clones! We teach you step by step and if you ever have any questions, all you have to do is post in our course discussion to receive help from Atil or Joe! Not only only will you learn with more than 15 hours of HD video, but you will also learn about designing your applications in Sketch. This will give your applications a professional touch and separate your app from all of the others! We also show you step by step how to submit your new app to the Google Play Store!"
